Dataset source: https://github.com/yannie28/Global-Superstore/blob/master/Global_Superstore(CSV).csv


Steps followed : 

1) Data cleaning :

    1. Handled missing values by filling them 0
    2. Remove duplicate rows
    3. Detect and handle outliers using IQR and Z-scores statistical techniques

    1. Correlation Matrix Heatmap indicates :
        - Quantity increases with Discount

   2. Use scatter plots to study the relationship between Profit and Discount.
   3.  Visualize sales distribution by Region and Category using bar plots and pie charts.



4) Predictive Modeling:
   
    1. Handled outliers
    2. Creating and training model
    3. Print some predictions
    4. Evaluate the Model
    5. Predict Sales
    6. Visualize Predicted vs Actual Sales
    7. Visualize residuals
